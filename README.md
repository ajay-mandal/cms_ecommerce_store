## E-commerce Store 
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This is the store of CMS project that I built. It consist of two parts i.e admin panel and ecommerce store. Beauty of the project is that user can manage all of his store from single dashboard and get analytic review in graph format about each store.

## Tech Stack
- Nextjs14 - Full Stack Framework
- Tailwindcss & Shadcnui - Styling 
- Typescript - Primary Language
